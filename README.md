# Ceasar_cipher
Hey this is J0ey, this program is a very basic Caesar cipher encoder/decoder. In order to use this program, you will need to have Python installed. <br/>
You can check if you have it by going to the terminal and entering<br/>
```python --version```, ```python```, or ```py```<br/>
If not you can download Python on Linux:<br/>
```sudo apt install python```<br/>
You can change the packet manager in the line above, if you don't use "apt".<br/>
For Windows you can visit the Python website below:<br/>
```https://www.python.org/downloads```<br/>
Choose your windows version and follow instructions from there.<br/>
To download the code from Linux enter ```git clone https://github.com/J0eyhacksgibsons/Caesar_cipher.git```<br/>
For Windows: you can copy it or save it as a zip from the top right of the code.<br/>
To run the code in the command line while in the same directory ```python caesar_cipher.py```<br/>
It should work from there.<br/>
